      <h1 id="love">Unicorns are Amazing! </h1>
      A unicorn is a mythical creature similar to a horse with a single horn.
      The word unicorn means “one-horn”
      Unicorns are typically described white, but actually, they can be of any color!
      Unicorns do not have wings.
      When a unicorn has wings, they are called Alacorns.
      Horses with wings are called Pegasi.
      The Unicorn constellation is called monoceros.
      Unicorns also have super-speed and super-strength and, more importantly, they can sense when the water is poisoned and can purify it.
      Unicorns have big appetites and their basic diet consists of grass, plants, flowers and berries.
